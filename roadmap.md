# Project Roadmap ‚Äì PLO5 Mobile Trainer

> **Purpose** ‚Äî Provide a clear, trackable breakdown of work for the first release of the PLO-5 Mobile Trainer PWA. Two milestones are defined, focused on building the Wrap-Counter first and the Equity-Judger second.

---

## Milestone 1 ‚Äì Wrap-Counter MVP ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
**Goal**: Users can open the app, pick or input a flop, and instantly see the max-wrap size (20/17/16 ‚Ä¶) along with example hole-card wraps. All functionality runs fully client-side and the site can be exported statically.

| # | Task | Owner | Status |
|---|------|-------|--------|
| 1.1 | **Project scaffolding** ‚Äì ensure Next 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, PostCSS are configured; dark-mode via `layout.tsx`. | | ‚úÖ |
| 1.2 | **Card asset** ‚Äì implement `<PlayingCard>` component using Unicode suits; responsive sizing (sm/md/lg). | | ‚úÖ |
| 1.3 | **Data pipeline** ‚Äì comprehensive `public/data/wraps.json` with 36k+ lines covering all flop combinations and wrap calculations. | | ‚úÖ |
| 1.4 | **Routing** ‚Äì create `/wrap` page with dynamic `/wrap/[flop]` routes for specific flop targeting; clean URL structure. | | ‚úÖ |
| 1.5 | **WrapQuiz UI** ‚Äì build `<WrapQuiz>` component with mobile-optimized grid layout:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;‚Ä¢ shows random flop or specific flop from URL  
&nbsp;&nbsp;‚Ä¢ quiz buttons for user guess (20/17/16/13/‚Ä¶ options)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;‚Ä¢ reveal answer with 2-4 wrap examples in responsive grid  
&nbsp;&nbsp;‚Ä¢ beautiful card components with proper shadows and proportions. | | ‚úÖ |
| 1.6 | **Add-My-Own-Hand flow (Wrap)** ‚Äì modal with 5 hero + 3 board pickers; compute wrap size in JS; display result. | | ‚è≥ |
| 1.7 | **URL state** ‚Äì case-insensitive flop targeting via `/wrap/45J` URLs for shareability and investigation. | | ‚úÖ |
| 1.8 | **Accessibility & mobile UX** ‚Äì mobile-first non-scrollable design, optimized touch targets, proper ARIA labels, responsive grid layout. | | ‚úÖ |
| 1.10 | **Desktop layout optimization** ‚Äì resolved desktop squishing bugs, implemented responsive width strategies, enhanced component spacing for cross-device consistency. | | ‚úÖ |
| 1.9 | **Static export** ‚Äì verified `pnpm build` works perfectly; zero errors, optimized bundles, ready for deployment. | | ‚úÖ |
| 1.3b | **Comprehensive wrap data** ‚Äì complete dataset with deterministic wrap calculations, max outs detection, nut outs tracking. | | ‚úÖ |

**Exit criteria**: ‚úÖ **ACHIEVED** - Mobile-optimized wrap counter with perfect UX, case-insensitive flop targeting, comprehensive dataset, static export ready.

## Milestone 2 ‚Äì Equity-Judger MVP
**Goal**: Users can estimate hero vs. villain equity for predefined hand-class confrontations or custom spots using a WASM equity engine stub.

| # | Task | Owner | Status |
|---|------|-------|--------|
| 2.1 | **WASM equity stub** ‚Äì scaffold Rust/C++ project (placeholder) that returns deterministic pseudo-equity; expose via `@plo5/equity-wasm`. | | ‚è≥ |
| 2.2 | **Build script** ‚Äì docs + command in README for compiling stub (`wasm-pack build --target web`). | | ‚è≥ |
| 2.3 | **Presets data** ‚Äì add `public/data/presets.json` with equity drill catalog (hand class vs wrap size buckets). | | ‚è≥ |
| 2.4 | **Routing** ‚Äì create `/equity-judger` page and navigation. | | ‚è≥ |
| 2.5 | **Core components** ‚Äì implement:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;‚Ä¢ `<EquitySlider>` ‚Äì draggable range to guess %  
&nbsp;&nbsp;‚Ä¢ `<HandClassPicker>` ‚Äì dropdown for villain class  
&nbsp;&nbsp;‚Ä¢ `<EquityQuiz>` ‚Äì orchestrates quiz flow. | | ‚è≥ |
| 2.6 | **Add-My-Own-Hand flow (Equity)** ‚Äì reuse card picker modal; call WASM stub to return hero/villain equity; bucket & display result. | | ‚è≥ |
| 2.7 | **URL state** ‚Äì sync quiz params for share links. | | ‚è≥ |
| 2.8 | **Accessibility & mobile UX** ‚Äì ensure controls are operable with screen readers/touch. | | ‚è≥ |
| 2.9 | **Static export & deploy** ‚Äì confirm full export with both modules. | | ‚è≥ |

**Exit criteria**: Equity estimations return within ¬±5 % bucket of stubbed truth, Add-My-Own flow functional, app exports statically with both drills accessible.

## Nice-to-Have Backlog (post-MVP)
* Replace WASM stub with real Monte-Carlo engine
* Add-My-Own-Hand flow for wrap counter (1.6)
* Enhanced quiz state persistence in URLs
* Plausible analytics integration
* Unit tests with Jest + RTL
* CI pipeline (lint, type-check, build, export)
* Custom card art
* PWA install prompt & offline caching
